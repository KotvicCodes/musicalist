This application aims to help you print some metadata about songs and artist you provided. Initially it seeks to provide music genres, but it'll give you more data.  
  
It parses data from Spotify using website [Chosic](https://www.chosic.com), and gets through the cookie policies with [I still don't care about Cookies](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/I-Still-Dont-Care-About-Cookies?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme) browser extension. The UI of the app is made with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org).
