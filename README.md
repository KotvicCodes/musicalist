Beware the app is still in ravenous development, and there's no official 1.0.0 package released yet. It mostly works, however.  
  
This app aims to help you get metadata (including interprets, album name, release date, genres from Spotify and Wikipedia alike) about songs you provide. It might provide you with more data in the future.  
  
It parses data from Spotify using website [Chosic](https://www.chosic.com), and gets through the cookie policies with [I still don't care about Cookies](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/I-Still-Dont-Care-About-Cookies?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme) browser extension. The UI of the app is made with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org).  
  
This project's packages honor the [Semantic Versioning protocol](https://semver.org) or will do so, when they are released.
