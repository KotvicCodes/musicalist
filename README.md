# Musicalist
This application aims to help you print some metadata about songs and artist you provided. Initially it seeks to provide music genres, but it'll give you more data.  
It parses data from Spotify using website [Chosic](https://www.chosic.com)  

## Todo list:
- add license  
- add UI  
- make the extension work for geners
- add some further functionality
